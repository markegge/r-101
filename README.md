R is an open source statistical programming language. R is commonly used for data science. 

This repository contains the files I use to teach a brief crash course on R. It covers R basics, key data types, accessors, control structures, a few helpful tips and tricks, and a brief introduction to the powerful data.table package.

Course Modules:

* 1-intro.R: What is R, Getting Started

* 2-data-structures.R: Data Structures in R (Vectors, Lists, and Data Frames)

* 3-subsetting-and-accessors.R: Subsetting and Accessors (Getting Specific Items of Data)

* 4-control-structures.R: Programming Control Structures (If / Else, Loops, etc.)

* 5-read-write-and-tips.R: Utility Functions, Saving / Loading Data

* 6-data-table.R: Intro to the data.table package for data management


## Part 2: Twelve Week In Depth Course

Also included in the repository is a suggested curriculum (primarily based on DataCamp courses) to develop the skills necessary to create interactive applications for analysis of large datasets.
